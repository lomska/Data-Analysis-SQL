In this [notebook](https://github.com/lomska/Data-Analysis-SQL/blob/main/World_Bank_Population_Estimates_Analysis/World_Bank_Population_Estimates_Analysis.ipynb), we look at world population growth trends using the World Bank's World Population Estimates and Projections database. It contains data on the total number and growth rate of the population, its age structure, fertility and mortality, net migration, the share of urban and rural population, and other series for the period from 1960 to 2022 and the forecast period until 2050.

<b>We are going to find answers to questions such as:</b>

- How much has population growth slowed globally and in individual regions and countries?
- Which countries will account for the world's population growth in the coming decades?
- Which regions of the world will dominate in population in 2050?
- How many countries are losing population?
- In which regions and countries has the birth rate fallen below the population replacement level?
- Which countriesâ€™ populations are considered "aged," "super-aged," or "ultra-aged"?
- Which countries are driving global urbanization?
