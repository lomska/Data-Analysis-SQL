In this [notebook](https://github.com/lomska/Data-Analysis-SQL/blob/main/Superstore_Data_Analysis/Superstore_Performance_Analysis.ipynb), we'll explore the latest Tableau EU Superstore data set, which compiles sales performance data for a fictitious retail chain for the years 2019â€“2022. We'll analyze the data as if it were real, although the results of a number of queries will clearly reveal that it is man-made.

<b>We'll find answers to questions such as:</b>
- How did annual and monthly sales, profits, orders', and customers' numbers change year-over-year?
- How do they vary by region, country, product category, sub-category, and consumer segment?
- Which countries, cities, and product subcategories account for the majority of sales and profits?
- Which ones bring losses?
- What goods are most often purchased together with others?
- What goods are most often returned by customers?
- Is the chain successful in maintaining relationships with existing customers and attracting new ones?
- Is the discount policy effective?
