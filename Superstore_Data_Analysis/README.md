In this project, I'll explore the latest Tableau EU Superstore data set, which compiles sales performance data for a fictitious European retail chain "Superstore" for the years 2019-2022. The Superstore data set is initially an Excel file with three sheets for orders, returns, and people (“managers” of the company). The database I created from it simply copies this structure: it is also an orders table, a returns table, and a people table.

I will analyze as if the data were real, although the results of a number of queries will clearly show that the data is man-made.

Some questions we will find answers to:
* How did the number of orders, customers, geography, sales volume, and profitability of the retail network change by year and month in annual terms?
* How do sales and profitability vary by product category, subcategory, and country?
* What kind of products are more actively sold—low-margin or high-margin?
* What percentage of orders bring losses annually?
* How do product subcategories contribute to losses?
* Which cities contribute to losses?
* What percentage of orders are returned annually?
* What percentage of products are returned in each subcategory?
* How does customer lifetime value change from year to year?
* How many sales are generated by existing customers, and how many by new ones?
* In which subcategories does the discount amount exceed the actual profit?

I will plot some query results using Matplotlib.
